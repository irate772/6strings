Guitars in the blockchain are worth more?

6 Strings Project (6S) is an asset tracking ledger of guitars, they're makers, sellers, buyers. 


We track the value of guitars by many different factors. The rewards for owning these instruments are great for many different reasons. 

We are designing a method and procedure that will make owning, buying, trading, and tracking guitars on one of the safest networks in the music industry. You can also earn extra "strings" to increase the value of your "portfolio" 

Hyperledger Fabric is the main engine that will “bend the strings” to the note that we need to get to. See our existing CTO, ACL and JS

We are in the infancy stage of coding, but with additional help we can be testing by the 4th quarter of 2018 and fully functional with a release date of 1/1/2019.

All the help anyone can give us while we're putting the data together is greatly appreciated. Coders, developers, and scientists are all needed. Thanks.
