Guitars in the blockchain are worth more?

6 String Project (6S) is an asset tracking ledger of guitars, they're makers, sellers, buyers. 


We track the value of guitars by many different factors. The rewards for owning these instruments are great for many different reasons. 

We are designing a method and procedure that will make owning, buying, trading, and tracking guitars on one of the safest networks in the music industry. You can also earn extra "strings" to increase the value of your "portfolio"
